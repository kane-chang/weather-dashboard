## Weather Dashboard
A helpful weather dashboard that allows you to get key weather information on any city!

## Usage

Here is a link to the deployed [weather dashboard](https://kane-chang.github.io/weather-dashboard). Search any city to display its current weather information as well as its 5-day weather forecast. Your search history will be saved as buttons which can be clicked on to redisplay the selected city's weather information again! Your search history will be saved even after you leave the website and will still be there when you return to it. You can also clear your search history if you wish to do so using the clear history button.
